It is midnight in Hilliard, and Slender Man is chasing Chef in her car, with Chef in the driver's seat. When Slender Man tries to honk the horn, the car gets stuck in a tree. Irritably, he snaps at the Chef to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Slender Man takes a illegibly blurry photo of the trees's license plate.

Back at the cabin, Slander Man rants about the trees's screw-up with the car. When Chef timidly mentions that she memorized the tree's license plate number, Chef sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better driver. She dares to say, "Doggo", and he tosses her out of the cabin in a rage.

Meanwhile, Chef has broken into the Doggo Museum of Natural History to steal Puppers. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by her best friend judy, who is also there to make her feel better from the museum's cute Puppers. The two women are cornered by big large Doggos. Chef grabs a dog treat and smashes it, creating a cloud of dust that disables the Doggos and lets them get away. As they speed away in Chef's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a new hiest".

Chef takes judy to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, judy discovers a computer, and declares that Chef needs a pupper. They plan their first hiest and the next morning, they invade the Doggo Museum of Natural History, tie them up with leashes, and then steal Puppers. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Hilliard.

Elsewhere, Slender Man has traced Chefs license plate number to an empty house in westbrook. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his Buddys nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Judy and Chef Steal 5 Puppers". Slender Man is enraged, because he wanted a Pupper.
