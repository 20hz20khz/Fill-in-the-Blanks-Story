It is midnight in the trap house, and Rayhan is chasing Samantha in her car, with Tim in the driver's seat. When Yunis tries to rob both of them, the car gets stuck in the corn fields. Irritably, he snaps at Samantha to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Yunis takes a illegibly blurry photo of Tim's license plate.

Back at Team 10 house, Jake rants about Yunis's screw-up with the car. When Rose timidly mentions that she memorized Tim's license plate number, Janice sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better eater. She dares to say, "you're ugly", and he tosses her out of the Team 10 house in a rage.

Meanwhile, Tessa has broken into the Faze Museum of Natural History to steal quickscopes. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by her friend, who is also there to copyright youtube videos from the museum's youtube channel. The two women are cornered by memes. her friend grabs a pokemon braclet and smashes it, creating a cloud of dank memes that disables quickscopes and lets them get away. As they speed away in Faze's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a minecraft series".

Team 10 takes CloutGang to their hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, dat boi discovers dank memes, and declares that he needs to steal them. They plan their first move and the next morning, they invade iFunny, tie them up with coffee beans, and then steal freshly baked memes. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Team 10's house.

Elsewhere, Keemstar has traced Tim's license plate number to an empty parking lot in Africa. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Minecraft youtuber gone missing!?!?". Tim is enraged, because he forgot to upload his minecraft lets play series.
