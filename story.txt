It is late at night in Tokyo, and BunnyBot is chasing Godzilla in her car, with Chuthulu in the driver's seat. When Superman tries to Sneeze, the car gets stuck in a pool of fidget spinners. Irritably, he snaps at Bill to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. BnnyBot takes a illegibly blurry photo of Godzilla's license plate.

PandaKai has traced Godzilla's license plate number to an empty Milk Jug in The fridge. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his Goons nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Godzilla Gets Stuck In Milk Jug". BunnyBot is enraged, because Godzilla is lactose intolerant.
