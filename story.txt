It is midnight in some random city no one cares about, and Collin is chasing the Capitlist System down in its car, with Tim in the driver's seat. When Collin tries to take down the Capitlist System, the car gets stuck in the Great Depression. Irritably, Tim snaps at Collin to hand over his camera, which he does after rummaging through his bag. Collin takes a illegibly blurry photo of the Capitilist System's license plate.

Back at Karl Marx's house, Tim rants about Collin's screw-up with the car. When Collin timidly mentions that he memorized the Capitilist System's license plate number, Tim sarcastically asks if he thinks he's a better camera. He dares to say, "yes", and he tosses him out of Karl Marx's house in a rage.

Meanwhile, the Capitlist System has broken into the some random city no one cares about's Museum of Natural History to steal the common class's money. It evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Gab, who is also there to also steal from the museum's common people's money. The two of them are cornered by Karl Marx. Gab grabs a smoke bomb and smashes it, creating a cloud of smoke that disables Karl Marx and lets them get away. As they speed away in the Capitlist System's car, it says, "This could be the beginning of a great partnership".

The Capitilist System takes Gab to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Gab discovers all the commoners' money, and declares that they needs to take it all. They plan their first heist together and the next morning, they invade the commoners, tie them up with rope, and then steal all their money. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over some random city no one cares about.

Elsewhere, Tim has traced the Collin's license plate number to an empty shack in some random town no one cares about. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his comrades nervously shows him the latest news headline: "The Capitlist System reigns supreme over some random town no one cares about". Tim is enraged, because he failed.
