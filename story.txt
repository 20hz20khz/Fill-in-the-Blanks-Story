It is midnight in Ohio, and Hugh Mungus is chasing Bob in her car, with a chicken in the driver's seat. When Bob tries to escape, the car gets stuck in mud. Irritably, he snaps at the chicken to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Bob takes a illegibly blurry photo of 
hugh's license plate.

Back at their hideout, Bob rants about the chicken's screw-up with the car. When the chicken timidly mentions that she memorized Hugh's license plate number, Bob sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better memer. She dares to say, "well uh technically uh yeah", and he tosses her out of the solar system in a rage.

Meanwhile, Robbie Rotten has broken into the Mini Museum of Natural History to steal a one carat diamond. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Hugh Mungus, who is also there to steal from the museum's lobby. The two women are cornered by a chicken. Hugh grabs powder that disables chicken and smashes it, creating a cloud of clout that disables the chicken and lets them get away. As they speed away in Hugh's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of an unnecessary".

Hugh takes Robbie to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Hugh discovers that the Earth is flat, and declares that it needs more cowbell. They plan their first heist and the next morning, they invade Mars, tie them up with chain, and then steal moon rocks. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over the Milky Way.

Elsewhere, Bob has traced the chickens license plate number to an empty warehouse in the Pacific Ocean. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his coworkers nervously shows him the latest news headline: "HASH-SLINGING SLASHER ON THE RISE". Bob is enraged, because he's not that dank.
