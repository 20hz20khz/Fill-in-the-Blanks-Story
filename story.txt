It is midnight in Hilliard, and Bob is chasing Patel in her car, with Patel in the driver's seat. When patel tries to drive, the car gets stuck in curry. Irritably, he snaps at the car to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Bob takes a illegibly blurry photo of Bob's license plate.

Back at home, patel rants about patel's screw-up with the car. When patel timidly mentions that she memorized bob's license plate number, patel sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better driver. She dares to say, "yes", and he tosses her out of the house in a rage.

Meanwhile, Kyle has broken into the indian Museum of Natural History to steal curry. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by bob, who is also there to steal stuff from the museum's vault. The two women are cornered by security. kyle grabs a flashbang and smashes it, creating a cloud of light that disables security and lets them get away. As they speed away in kyle's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a Indian movie".

kyle takes bob to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, kyle discovers a plan, and declares that bob needs money. They plan their first heist and the next morning, they invade the museum, tie them up with silly string, and then steal money. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over india.

Elsewhere, patel has traced bobs license plate number to an empty lot in ohio. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Bob is chasing cars". bob is enraged, because mad.
