It is midnight in Ohio, and a zombie is chasing dogs in her car, with a leg in the driver's seat. When it tries to kill the dog, the car gets stuck in a dich. Irritably, he drops at the dog to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. The dog takes a illegibly blurry photo of car's license plate.

Back at house, ants rants about her's screw-up with the car. When one timidly mentions that she memorized the car's license plate number, another one sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better driver. She dares to say, "die in a hole", and he tosses her out of their home in a rage.

Meanwhile, another car has broken into the national Museum of Natural History to steal money. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by a camera, who is also there to protect the diamond from the museum's rare colection. The two women are cornered by the robber. he grabs a fragile crystal and smashes it, creating a cloud of smoke that disables the surpport beams and lets them get away. As they speed away in the cool kid's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a horriable disaster".

She takes the money to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, she discovers the cops surounding the shed, and declares that she needs to come turn herself in. They plan their first exet route and the next morning, they invade the museum again, tie them up with duck tape, and then steal yet more money. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over the world.

Elsewhere, cops has traced the license plate number to an empty car in the middle of the highway. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his fellow cops nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Jet Plane Jumpped By thougs". He is enraged, because they got across the border.
