It is late at night in Alternia, and Insepcter Berrybreath is chasing Liaison Pumpkinsnuffle in her car, with Professor Pucefoot in the driver's seat. When Professor Pucefoot tries to press on the breaks, the car gets stuck in a huge blue tree with millions of their kind hanging from its branches. Irritably, he snaps at Insepctor Berrybreath to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Professor Pucefoot takes a illegibly blurry photo of Liaison Pumpkinsnuffle's license plate.

They bring the picture back to the head of the subjugulators, Terezi Pyrope. She traces the license plate number to an empty Cardboard box in THE CORNER OF HER ROOM! HOW COULD THIS BE? He's been right under their noses the entire time.How revolting Liaison Pumpkinsnuffle has become! They trusted him! The head Subjugulator, Redglare (she has decided that sounds way cooler than her actual name) grabs Pumpkinsnuffle and ties him up in a chair. Redglare grabs her wickedly amazing cane of justice and begins the interrogation. When he demands to know why he is tied in a chair, Redglare laughs at the digusting and ignorant criminal. 

She goes through her entire speech of justice then points her cane of justice at him. She saw the fear in his button eyes and the sweat coming from his plush forehead. Redglare decides this isn't as fun as she had hoped for. Time to raise the stakes! She pulls out her trusty subjugulator coin with a head on one side and a scratched head on the other side. Liaison Pumpkinsnuffle knows this game all too well. He's seen so many of his fellow justice workers fall from just one flip of her coin. If it lands heads, his name will be cleared for good, but if it's tails, he will most definitely be thrown out the window by a rope. 

The coin flips, almost in slow motion. He watches it. It falls on the table, it begins to spin and bounce from side to side. It has now landed heads. Liaison Pumpkinsnuffle sighs in relief but Redglare is laughing. Oh god! He has forgotten! THE SUBJUGULATOR IS BLIND!

Soon he was thrown out the window and hung from a tree branch. Justice is served.
