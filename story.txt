It is late at night in Las Vegas, and a girl is chasing me in her car, with a cat in the driver's seat. When she tries to run me over, the car gets stuck in a wall. Irritably, he snaps at her to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. He takes a illegibly blurry photo of Fiona's license plate.

Robert has traced Fionas license plate number to an empty garage in town. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "A big man attacks me at night!". Robert is enraged, because she did.
