It is late at night in Marimba Club, and Dylan is chasing Ding Smash in his car, with Rice in the driver's seat. When Dylan tries to flex, the car gets stuck in the X Theatre. Irritably, he Thanos snaps at Ding Smash to hand over his camera, which he does after rummaging through his bag. Dylan takes a illegibly blurry photo of Smith's license plate.

Dylan has traced Smith's license plate number to an empty seat in the PAC. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Dylan and Ewing duel in rock paper scissors". Ding Smash is enraged, because he has always wanted to beat Dylan.
