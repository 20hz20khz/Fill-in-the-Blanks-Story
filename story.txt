It is midnight in Forkville, and Fork is chasing Bork in her car, with urk in the driver's seat. 
When urk tries to wark, the car gets stuck in torque. Irritably, he snaps at Bork to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag.
Bork takes a illegibly blurry photo of Urk's license plate.
Back at Forkville, Bork rants about Urk's screw-up with the car. 
When Bork timidly mentions that she memorized Urk's license plate number, Fork sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better pork. 
She dares to say, "torque", and he tosses her out of Bork in a rage.
Meanwhile, Fork has broken into the Quork Museum of Natural History to steal Pork. 
She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Urk, who is also there to Fork Bomb from the museum's Quork. 
The two women are cornered by Urk.
 Urk grabs a pork and smashes it, creating a cloud of torque that disables York and lets them get away. 
As they speed away in Fork's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a Fork Bomb".
Fork takes Urk to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. 
As they talk, Fork discovers torque, and declares that Fork needs Bomb. 
They plan their first Bomb and the next morning, they invade York, tie them up with torque, and then steal Bomb. 
Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Forkville.
Elsewhere, Bork has traced Urk's license plate number to an empty Lork in pork. 
When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his porks nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Fork bomb, work calm". Fork is enraged, because there is a Fork bomb and he didn't create it yet..
