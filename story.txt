It is late at night in Fortnite, and ninja is chasing bunny in her car, with a grenade in the driver's seat. When bunny tries to escape, the car crashes in between two trees. Irritably, she took away ninja's boogie bomb, which she does after sniping him. Ninja takes a illegibly blurry photo of Bunny's's license plate before dying.

Ninja has traced bunny's license plate number to an empty lot in walmart. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Bunny sniped 30 Ninjas". Ninja is enraged, because all 30 ninjas were him.
