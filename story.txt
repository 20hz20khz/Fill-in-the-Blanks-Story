It is midnight in Kyoto, and Tim is chasing Oprah in her car, with Vladimir Putin in the driver's seat. When Tim tries to jump in the window, the car gets stuck in a sushi resturant. Irritably, he snaps at Oprah to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Tim takes a illegibly blurry photo of Oprah's license plate.

Back at home, Vlad rants about Tim's screw-up with the car. When Oprah timidly mentions that she memorized Tim's license plate number, Vladimir sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better tae kwon do-er. She dares to say, "Without a doubt", and he tosses her out of Japan in a rage.

Meanwhile, Tim has broken into the Djibouti Museum of Natural History to steal the worlds largest Bey-Blade. He evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by his fat extra toe, who is also there to trip him from the museum's floor. The two women are cornered by Vladimir. Tim grabs a toothbrush and smashes it, creating a cloud of radiation that disables Vladimir and lets them get away. As they speed away in Oprah's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a Toe Disease".

Tim takes the Beyblade to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Tim discovers he has a Toe disease, and declares that he needs ointment. They plan their first mission and the next morning, they invade the pharmacy, tie them up with dental floss, and then steal medicine. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Asia.

Elsewhere, Oprah has traced Tim's license plate number to an empty field in Seoul. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his Toes nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Tim has smelly feet". Tim is enraged, because it's true.
