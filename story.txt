It is midnight in Gotham, and Alex is chasing Gab in her car, with a cat in the driver's seat. When Collin tries to fly, the car gets stuck in the cloud. Irritably, he snaps at Alex to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Alex takes a illegibly blurry photo of Gab's license plate.

Back at Gotham, Collin rants about Alex's screw-up with the car. When Alex timidly mentions that she memorized Gab's license plate number, Collin sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better Collin. She dares to say, "Meow", and he tosses her out of the window in a rage.

Meanwhile, Katie has broken into the Cat Museum of Natural History to steal Mr.Meows. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Alex, who is also there to eat chocolate from the museum's ceiling. The two women are cornered by spiders. KAtie grabs a Alex and smashes it, creating a cloud of spook that disables children and lets them get away. As they speed away in Gab's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a crazy cat lady".

Katie takes Alex to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Alex discovers the meaning of life, and declares that Katie needs cats. They plan their first mission and the next morning, they invade the cat cafe, tie them up with yARN, and then steal mR.mEOWSA. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over gOTHAM.
Elsewhere, Alex has traced Gab's license plate number to an empty Denny's in Weebtown. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his agents nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Mr.Meowsa stolen!". Gab is enraged, because Mr.Meowsa is Gab's mom.
