It is midnight in Australia, and Elizabeth is chasing Dr.Robotnik in her car, with Robin in the driver's seat. When Dr.Robotnik tries to hit them, the car gets stuck in a ditch. Irritably, Robin snaps at Elizabeth to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Robin takes an illegibly blurry photo of Robotnik's license plate.

Back in Sydney, Robin rants about Elizabeth's screw-up with the car. When Elizabeth timidly mentions that she memorized The Doctor's license plate number, Jeff Gordon sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better hero. She dares to say, "Well of course, Robin after all is only a sidekick ", and he tosses her out of the meeting in a rage.

Meanwhile, Robotnik has broken into the Community Museum of Natural History to steal The Sandwich of Awesomeness. He evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by his minion Darill, who is also there to help steal the sandwich from the museum's Greek exhibit. The two are cornered by Robin. The minion grabs a clay pot and smashes it, creating a cloud of dust that disables the lasers and lets them get away. As they speed away in Robotnik's car, Darill says, "This could be the beginning of a beautiful chain of heists".

Robotnik takes Darill to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Darill discovers the location of the base, and declares that they need a plan. They plan their first part and the next morning, they invade the Sydney lab, tie Robin and Elizabeth up with ropes, and then take The Sandwich of Awesomeness. Before long, they are committing a crimes all over town.

Elsewhere, Elizabeth has traced Robotnik's license plate number in an empty house in the Sahara Desert. When Robotnik comes back from his nap, he demands to know why his sandwich missing, which Darill nervously shows him the latest news headline: "The Sandwich of Awesomeness is saved and taken from sleeping villan!". Robotnik is enraged, because that sandwich was the love of his life.
