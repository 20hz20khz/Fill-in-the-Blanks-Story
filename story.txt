It is late at night in Kekistan, and Lauren Southern is chasing angry protesters in her car, with Steven Crowder in the driver's seat. When Crowder tries to do a barrel roll, the car gets stuck in an anti-trump protest. Irritably, he snaps at Lauren to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Crowder takes a illegibly blurry photo of the protester's license plate.

Crowder has traced the protester's license plate number to an empty vegan restraunt in California. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his staff nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Angry protester arrested for slapping cop infront of vegan". Crowder is enraged, because that was going to be his big story.
