It is midnight in hilliard, and Tim is chasing Miley in her car, with Dullah in the driver's seat. When Dullah tries to leave, the car gets stuck in maple syrup. Irritably, he snaps at Miley to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Tim takes a illegibly blurry photo of Dullah's license plate.

Back at Tim, Miley rants about Tim's screw-up with the car. When Tim timidly mentions that she memorized Dullahs's license plate number, Tim sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better driver. She dares to say, "yes", and he tosses her out of the car in a rage.

Meanwhile, Alissa Violet has broken into the Team 10 Museum of Natural History to steal exclusive merch. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Lia, who is also there to steal merch from the museum's rare items. The two women are cornered by Jake Paul. Alissa grabs a smoke bomb and smashes it, creating a cloud of smoke that disables Jake's dabs and lets them get away. As they speed away in Ricegum's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a Youtube ragewar".

Alissa takes Lia to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Lia discovers Ricegum, and declares that Ricegum needs merch. They plan their first attack and the next morning, they invade Team 10 house, tie them up with Fruit rollups, and then steal the merch. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over America.

Elsewhere, Tim has traced  Dullah's plate number to an empty sheet of paper in his hideout. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his body guards nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Jake Paul loses his merch". Tim is enraged, because jake Paul is his number 1 fan and he'll do anything to promote his merch.
