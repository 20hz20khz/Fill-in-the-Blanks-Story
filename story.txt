It is midnight in Hilliard, and Zach is chasing Sarah in her car, with Holden in the driver's seat. When Sarah tries to turn, the car gets stuck in a ditch. Irritably, he snaps at Sarah to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Zach takes a illegibly blurry photo of Sarah's license plate.

Back at Home, Zach rants about Sarah's screw-up with the car. When Sarah timidly mentions that she memorized Zach's license plate number, Sarah sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better Driver. She dares to say, "Yes", and he tosses her out of The house in a rage.

Meanwhile, Ally has broken into the United states Museum of Natural History to steal The declaration of independence. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Halley, who is also there to steal things from the museum's Gift shop. The two women are cornered by teh alarm. Halley grabs a artifact and smashes it, creating a cloud of magic dust that disables alarm and lets them get away. As they speed away in Ally's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a Good Friendship".

Ally takes Halley to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Halley discovers Ally, and declares that Ally needs Halley. They plan their first heist and the next morning, they invade the smithsonian, tie them up with rope, and then steal everything. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over the united states.

Elsewhere, Zach has traced sarah's license plate number to an empty car in hilliard. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his co-workers nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Smithsonian robbed!!!". Zach is enraged, because he wanted to stop them.
