It is midnight in Candyland, and Colin is chasing Mr.Riley in her car, with Katie in the driver's seat. When Colin tries to guilt trip Mr.Riley, the car gets stuck in a time loop. Irritably, he snaps at Mr.Riley to hand over his camera, which he does after rummaging through his bag. Colin takes a illegibly blurry photo of Mr.Riley's license plate.

Back at CandyLand, Dominic rants about Hunter's screw-up with the car. When Hunter timidly mentions that he memorized Mr.Riley's license plate number, Dominic sarcastically asks if he thinks he's a better student. He dares to say, "Of course I am", and he tosses him out of the garage in a rage.

Meanwhile, Kai has broken into the Hitler Museum of Natural History to steal the Mien Kemp. He evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by the puppy, who is also there to kill with kidness from to the museum's security guards. The two women are cornered by Cerbus. Zeus grabs a trident and smashes it, creating a cloud of golden smoke that disables the security guards and lets them get away. As they speed away in Kai's car, he says, "This could be the beginning of a the Greek Gods".

Kai takes the trident dust to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Dominic discovers that Hunter is a God, and declares that Hunter needs to stop Kai. They plan their first attack and the next morning, they invade Kai's house, tie him up with shoe ties, and then steal the Mein Kemp. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over CandyLand.

Elsewhere, Colin has traced Mr.Rileys license plate number to an empty parking lot in Australia. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his dog's nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Hunter has taken down Kai". Kai is enraged, because he is in jail.
