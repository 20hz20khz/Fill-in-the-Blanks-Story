It is midnight in Zimbabwe, and Tim(girl) is chasing Rayhan in her car, with Abdullah in the driver's seat. When Tim tries to turn, the car gets stuck in a pool. Irritably, he snaps at Abdullah to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Tim takes a illegibly blurry photo of Rayhan's license plate.

Back at in the barnyard, Abdullah rants about Tim's screw-up with the car. When Tim timidly mentions that she memorized Rayhans's license plate number, Abdullah sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better Driver. She dares to say, "bet", and he tosses her out of the barnyard in a rage.

Meanwhile, Rayhan has broken into the the Museum of Natural History to steal szechuan sauce. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Abdullah, who is also there to find Rayham from the museum's security. The two women are cornered by dogs. Rayhan grabs a glass and smashes it, creating a cloud of smoke that disables the cameras and lets them get away. As they speed away in Abdullah's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a great romance".

Rayhan takes Abdullah to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Rayhan discovers a photo, and declares that he needs to steal more sauce. They plan their first attack and the next morning, they invade McDonalds, tie them up with french fries, and then steal the sauce. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Hilliard.

Elsewhere, Abdullah has traced Rayhan's license plate number to an empty lot in Wal-Mart. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his Co-Workers nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Rayhan and Tim Steal". Abdullah is enraged, because that was his teamate.
