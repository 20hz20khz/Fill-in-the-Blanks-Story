It is midnight in America, and Nicki Manaj is chasing Trump in her car, with Jay-Z in the driver's seat. When Jay-Z tries to pull out a machine gun, the car gets stuck in double chocolate fudge with a cherry on top. Irritably, he snaps at Nicki to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Jay-Z takes a illegibly blurry photo of Donald Trump's license plate.

Back at North Korea, Kim Jong-un rants about Jay-Z's screw-up with the car. When Nicki timidly mentions that she memorized Trump's license plate number,  sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better Korean than Jong-Un. She dares to say, "See y'alls on the flip side", and he tosses her out of his gothic castle in a rage.

Meanwhile, Nicki has broken into the Great Captialist Museum of Natural History to steal some cash money$$$. She evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Jay-Z, who is also there to steal some ca$h moneyz from the museum's Great Captialist Vault of Capitalism. The two are cornered by Donald Trump. He grabs a Heinz ketchup bottle and smashes it, creating a cloud of mustard that disables himself(!) and lets them get away. As they speed away in Nicki's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a coup d'etat".

Nicki takes Jay-Z to her hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Jay-Z discovers communism, and declares that Kim needs this economic practice that has NEVER, EVER failed before to give Kim ultimate power . They plan their first coup d'etat and the next morning, they invade Trump Tower, tie him up with Jeb Bush, and then steal the declaration of Independence. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over America.

Elsewhere, Jay-Z has traced Trump's license plate number to an empty abandoned factory in North Korea. When he demands to know why Kim hasn't come back yet, one of his Friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Nicki Manaj Betrays Jay-Z". He is enraged, because betrayal, bro.
