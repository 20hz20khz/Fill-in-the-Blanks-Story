It is midnight in Bikini Bottom, and Sandy is chasing Spongebob in her car, with Ms. Puff in the driver's seat. When Plankton tries to Steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, the car gets stuck in Reverse. Irritably, he snaps at Pearl to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Squilliam Fancyson takes a illegibly blurry photo of Squidward's license plate.

Back at The Krusty Krab, Spongebob rants about Squidward's screw-up with the car. When Ms. Puff timidly mentions that she memorized Sandy's license plate number, Karen sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better Chef. She dares to say, "nice meme", and he tosses her out of the Krusty Krab in a rage.

Meanwhile, Plankton has broken into the Krusty Krab Museum of Natural History to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula. He evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Mr. Krabs, who is also there to Smell the Money from the museum's Money Vault. The two men are cornered by Spongebob. Squidward grabs a Krabby Patty and smashes it, creating a cloud of Patties that disables Plankton's disguise and lets them get away. As they speed away in Mr. Krabs' car, he says, "This could be the beginning of a meme".

Spongebob takes Patrick to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Mr. Krabs discovers them, and declares that they need to go painty raiding. They plan their first heist and the next morning, they invade Mr. Krabs' mothers house, and tie them up with Squidward's Clarinet, and then steal Mr. Krabs' meme. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over Bikinni Bottom.

Elsewhere, Spongebob has traced Sandy's license plate number to an empty Dome in Bikinni Bottom. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his meme nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Maniac in Bikini Bottom". Skldfj is enraged, because he doesn't exist.
