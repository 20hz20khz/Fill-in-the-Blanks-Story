It is midnight in Cincinnati, and Gab is chasing Katie in his car, with Paval in the driver's seat. When a wild collin tries to spread the revolution, the car gets stuck in famine. Irritably, he snaps at Paval to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Gab takes a illegibly blurry photo of the communist's license plate.

Back at Freedomtown, Alex rants about Gab's screw-up with the car. When Gab timidly mentions that he memorized the communist's license plate number, Gab sarcastically asks if he thinks he's a better game desiger. he dares to say, "heck no", and he tosses him out of the window in a rage.

Meanwhile, Collin has broken into the Freedom Museum of Capitalism History to steal the priceless works of Ayn Rand. he evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by katie, who is also there to take a cat from the museum's pet shop. The two humans are cornered by Police. Katie grabs a copy of the communist manifesto and smashes it, creating a cloud of DEATH AND FAMINE AND POLITCAL INSTABLILTY that disables the security measures and lets them get away. As they speed away in Collin's car, she says, "This could be the beginning of a new revolution".

Collin takes Katie to his Shack, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Collin reads the book, and declares that capitalism needs to die. They plan their first Bomb and the next morning, they invade the school, ties up the staff with Failed socialist policies, and then steal the cookies. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over the city.

Elsewhere, Alex has traced Collin's license plate number to an empty lot in Dublin. When he demands to know Katie hasn't come back yet, one of his Cats nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Communist revolution lead by Collin and a Kat!". Alex is enraged, because "I DIDNT PAY FOR THIS STORY JEEZ".
