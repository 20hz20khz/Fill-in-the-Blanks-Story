It is midnight in garbage town, and Rayhan is chasing good grades in his car, with Mr. Riggs in the driver's seat. When Rayhan tries to pass high school, the car gets stuck in air. Irritably, he snaps at Mr. Riggs to hand over his camera, which he does after rummaging through his bag. Rayhan takes a illegibly blurry photo of good grades' license plate.

Back at home, Rayhan rants about the math test's screw-up with the car. When Mr. Riggs timidly mentions that he memorized good grade's license plate number, Mr. Riggs sarcastically asks if he thinks he's a better test taker. He dares to say, "Chuck", and he tosses him out of class in a rage.

Meanwhile, Mr. Riley has broken into the international Museum of Natural History to steal video games. he evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Sujay, who is also there to steal league money from the museum's ATM. The two men are cornered by redditors. Sujay grabs an LED gamer mouse and smashes it, creating a cloud of debris that disables league's servers and lets them get away. As they speed away in Sujay's car, he says, "This could be the beginning of a let's play".

Sujay takes Mr. Riley to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Mr. Riley discovers Overwatch, and declares that reddit needs a real video game. They plan their first comp game and the next morning, they invade comp, tie them up with aimbots, and then steal victory. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over reddit.

Elsewhere, Rayhan has traced good grade's license plate number to an empty drive in theatre. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his report cards nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Rayhan skips class again". Sujay is enraged, because League of Legends is not a real video game.
