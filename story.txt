It is midnight in some city, and Kirby is chasing Meta Knight in his car, with Allen in the driver's seat. When Allen tries to that flip thing, the car gets stuck in a tree. Irritably, he snaps at Lavi to hand over his camera, which he does after rummaging through her bag. Lavi takes a illegibly blurry photo of Meta Knight's license plate.

Back at the police office, Flynn rants about Allen's screw-up with the car. When Lavi timidly mentions that he memorized Kanda's license plate number, Flynn sarcastically asks if he thinks he's a better Rhino. He dares to say, "Nomm7", and he tosses him out of the window in a rage.

Meanwhile, Link has broken into the Pottery Museum of Natural History to steal Pottery. He evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Cloud, who is also there to clean toilets from the museum's restrooms. The two men are cornered by dogs. Link grabs a pot and smashes it, creating a cloud of red stuff that disables the alarms and lets them get away. As they speed away in Estelle's car, he says, "This could be the beginning of a revolution againts pottery".

On another note, Kanda takes Yuri to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, Yuri discovers dvds, and declares that Kanda needs help. They plan their first murder and the next morning, they invade the government, tie them up with spider silk, and then steal a sword. Before long, they are committing a spree of crimes all over the city.

Elsewhere, Mario has traced Luigi's license plate number to an empty truck in something. When he demands to know why he hasn't come back yet, one of his friends nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Local man ruins everything". Mario is enraged, because this always happens.
